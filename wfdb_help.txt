Using data from MIT database

signals, fields = wfdb.rdsamp('100')
	reads the patient ecg
	signals - returns multi channel recording
	fields - returns some annotation data
		'sig_name' is the 2 channel sources


first = []
second = []
for i in range(0,1000):
    first.append(signals[i][0])
    second.append(signals[i][1])

	can be used to separate the multi channel recordings into 1D arrays

loc = processing.find_local_peaks(first,250)
loc2 = processing.find_local_peaks(second,250)
	finds the local peaks
	input variables: signal, range to look for peak
	can be used to find spike from heart beat

annotation = wfdb.rdann('101', 'atr', sampto = 1000)
	reads annotation file
	print(annotation.sample)
		shows the indeces where there are annotations
	print(annotation.symbol)
		shows the annotation symbols
